### About the Project
<!-- Describe what the over all scope and learning goal of the project is, and what set-up the challenge was framed in-->
The take-home is meant to simulate a task that you might receive during an interview process. The scope is smaller scale and open ended. The goal is to complete the task in 8 hours or less. Since there is a time limit and due to the tasks open ended nature, you should manage your time and plan appropriately. Not only is completing the take-home necessary, but also explaining your process and reasoning behind your decisions are equally important. Use this challenge to practice and learn how you can best solve and speak to your process.

Requirements:

At a minimum, you must show:
<ul>
  <li>A list of articles</li>
  <li>A “detailed” view for each article (as opposed to summary/list view)</li>
  <li>Articles in the list must link to the detailed article view you create</li>
  <li>Some sort of search, filter, OR sort</li>
</ul>

Things we’ll be looking for:

<ul>
  <li>A strong understanding of React JS and Front-End best practices</li>
  <li>Your ability to prioritize for MVP</li>
  <li>An understanding of basic usability practices and standards</li>
  <li>A clear hierarchy of information</li>
  <li>Clean, well thought out code</li>
</ul>
